# This is me :wave:

I am the GitHub Admin within Sophos. :star_struck:

If you are an internal Sophos user and need something complex done within GitHub then hit me up on Teams. 
I am constantly trying to clean up mail notifications so reaching out via GitHub will usually lead to a delay in response
